Quality assurance is the guidelines, policies, and procedures to make a high-quality product and avoid defects. In contrast, quality control is the productâ€™s actual review during production to ensure it is created to the highest standards. While quality assurance occurs during the entire process, from planning to maintenance of a product or project, quality control happens during the inspection phase.
